Python Lists
- the indexing and slicing is very similar to NumPy arrays
- are felxible and efficient containers for heterogeneous data
- can use where order of elements matters or where it can be addressed by a numeral
- use the slicing syntax to operate on sublists


Python Dictionaries
- map names to values
- are similar to Pandas DataFrames
- use where data items have, or can be, given labels
- most appropriate for collecting data items of different kinds
	 


Python Comprehensions
- Lets us create and modify lists and dicts with great ease
- are quick to write, easy to parse, and surprisingly powerful
- In many programming problems, all that youâ€™re doing is creating and manipulating lists and dictionaries and comprehensions are an easy way to do that
