NumPy
  - is the fundamental package for scientific computing within Python
  - reserves a space in memory and lays down all those values side by side
  - itâ€™s also necessary to interface Python with other languages such as C or Fortran, which count on data being laid out in memory in a simple fashion

NumPy dtypes
  - NumPy identifies several types of integers, depending on the number of bits that they take in they memorial presentation
    - Integers: numpy.int8, numpy.int16, numpy.int32, numpy.int64, 
        - Unsigned: numpy.uint8, etc. 
    - Floating-point number: numpy.float32, numpy.float64, numpy.float128
        - Complex: numpy.complex64, etc
